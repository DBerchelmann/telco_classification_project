<h1> TELCO CHURN CLASSIFICATION PROJECT </h1>

Hi there,

Welcome to the README file for the TELCO CHURN CLASSIFICATION PROJECT.

In here, you will find expanded information on this project including goals, how I will be working through the pipeline and a data dictionary to help offer more insight to the variables that are being used.

<h3><u>Data Dictionary</u></h3>
