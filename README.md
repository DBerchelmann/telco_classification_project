<h1> TELCO CHURN CLASSIFICATION PROJECT </h1>

Hi there,

Welcome to the README file for the TELCO CHURN CLASSIFICATION PROJECT.

In here, you will find expanded information on this project including goals, how I will be working through the pipeline and a data dictionary to help offer more insight to the variables that are being used.

-------------------
<h3><u>The Goal</u></h3>

<h3><u>Data Dictionary</u></h3>
    
-  As I work through the data, this section will eventually hold a data dictionary to assist the user in identifying the data type of features (columns) and a brief description.



|   Feature      |  Data Type   | Description    |
| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: |
|  Cell Contents | More Stuff   | And Again    |
| You Can Also   | Put Pipes In | Like this \| |

-------------------
  <h3><u>Hypothesis and Questions</u></h3>
 - Churn is being driven by customers use fiber optic internet who are single(no dependents) and on month to month contracts
 
 - Does having multiple phone lines influence churn?
 - Does having streaming service influence churn?
 - Is being on a monthly contract make one more likely to churn
 - Does a higher bill lead to churn?
